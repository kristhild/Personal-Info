                Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was 
                inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that 
                they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything 
                that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.
                "It's never good to give them details," Janice told her sister. "Always be a little vague and keep them guessing." Her 
                sister listened intently and nodded in agreement. She didn't fully understand what her sister was saying but that didn't matter. 
                She loved her so much that she would have agreed to whatever came out of her mouth.
                He wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends. It would be a risky move. Yes, the truth would make things a lot easier if 
                they all stayed on the same page, but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not 
                telling the truth. It was time to decide which way to go.
